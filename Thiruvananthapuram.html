        Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum) is the capital of the southern Indian state of Kerala.
        It's distinguished by its British colonial architecture and many art galleries.
        It’s also home to Kuthira Malika (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses and 
        displaying collections related to the Travancore royal family, 
        whose regional capital was here from the 18th–20th centuries.
        Thiruvananthapuram is known as the "Evergreen City of India" because of its green landscapes and the presence of many public parks.
        Thiruvananthapuram has historically been a cultural hub in South India due to the development of arts, architecture and liberal customs by the rulers of erstwhile Trivandrum. As a testimony to this, 
        renowned artists like Maharaja Swathi Thirunal and Raja Ravi Varma hail from the city.
